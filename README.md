Serverless functions in real time, isolated model, and its use from Blazor WASM.

To properly execute this code, you must keep in mind what is explained in the post: https://www.blazorspread.net/blogview/blazor-and-faas-(part-2)

> It is important to mention that if you clone the code in the Git repository, the *local.settings.json* files do not exist, so you will have to create them.
